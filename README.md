# Advent of Code 2020 in Kotlin

This repository is hosted [on Github](https://github.com/jlengrand/advent-of-code-2020).

* See each day (first version) in the main package
* The final package contains versions I have reworked to be better

If you want to see daily live coding and / or learnings *[have a look at my blog](https://lengrand.fr/advent-of-code-day-1-kotlin-til/)*, there is one entry per day.
